        <a name="phoenix">There are many things to learn in the simple, unpretentious documentary, 
        <I>In the Shadow of the Crow: The Legacies of the Narragansetts</I>.</a>Designed mainly for classroom use, the film delves into the history of 
        the tribe more thoroughly than schoolbooks do. It tries to convey a sense 
        of what it’s like to be a Narragansett today, in the aftermath of the 
        smoke shop incident two years ago and many Rhode Islanders’ resentment 
        over the possibility of a casino.Made on a shoestring budget of a few 
        thousand dollars pleaded and granted here and there, this isn’t the polished 
        sort of u will see in a film festival, but it is informative.The past 
        is prelude to the present, so the right historical detail can inform current 
        events. For example, the animosity between the state of Rhode Island and 
        the tribe gains dimension when you hear an 1880 state report bragging 
        that "their extinction as a tribe has been accomplished," that no tribal 
        members are left. We learn that despite such government efforts, the Narragansetts 
        re-tribalized in 1934. In 1978 the federal government granted them sovereignty 
        as a tribe, along with the 1800-acre Charlestown reservation. <br>
        <Br>
        School students are taught that Roger Williams was fair to the tribes 
        <img src="images/K_L.gif" alt="k&amp;L" width="250" height="199" align="right" hspace=4>he 
        met here, but few know very much about King Philip’s War and the Great 
        Swamp Massacre of 1675, which has been relegated to the "unfortunate incident" 
        dustbin of history. But the film succinctly gives the event context and 
        detail. <br>
        <Br>
        The background of the massacre involves Metacom (King Philip) forging 
        a tribal confederacy a few years earlier. His son, the sachem Canonchet, 
        didn’t join the alliance until the British put him in an ethical dilemma. 
        They demanded that he hand over all Wampanoags in his territory, whether 
        participants in the war or not, which would mean their being shipped to 
        the West Indies as slaves. Canonchet’s message to them: "No, not a Wampanoag 
        or a paring of a Wampanoag’s nail." So all women and children were sent 
        into the Great Swamp for their protection, and about 1000, including women 
        and children, were killed in the sanctuary. Genocide continued — though 
        the documentary never uses the word — and in a few years only about 200 
        Narragansetts from a pre-war population of 5000 to 7000 survived. <br>
        <Br>
        The 2003 smoke shop incident is central to the documentary, as it is to 
        the tribe today (see sidebar). Chief Sachem Matthew Thomas was among those 
        arrested. On camera he compares his people being arrested on land "sacred 
        to us" to synagogues being invaded by state police. He says he had to 
        talk two members of the tribe, depressed over the incident, out of suicide.	
        <br>
        <Br>
        Pam Ellis, a lawyer specializing in Indian rights, says in the film that 
        the smoke shop raid has widespread interest to tribes elsewhere, because 
        the controversy addresses "understanding the nature and scope of tribal 
        sovereignty." The legal question is whether the state needed federal authorization 
        to go onto reservation land, and both sides were arguing the issue in 
        federal court at the time. Ellis says she understands that the tribe would 
        have yielded to federal authority but not to state authority. <br>
        <Br>
        In the aftermath of the 1988 Federal Indian Gaming Act, which gave theoretical 
        rights for the tribe to have a casino in Charlestown, the prospect could 
        have been the subject of a full-length documentary in itself. But the 
        film keeps that mostly in the background, focusing instead on what it 
        means to be a Narragansett in such contentious times. Darrell Waldron, 
        executive director of the Rhode Island Indian Council, speaks not only 
        about racism from outside the tribe but also a "pecking order" within. 
        "Everybody needs somebody else to pick on," he says. "This one’s too black 
        to be native, this one’s too white to be native . . . ." A Narragansett 
        and Wampanoag couple, Michael and Gunise Bliss, tell how their 10-year-old 
        daughter stopped dancing and "went out of the circle" at a powwow ceremonial 
        dance when she was accused of being "a wannabe." They go on to talk about 
        the values of being traditional. As Guinise declares, "We know who we 
        are."<I>In the Shadow of the Crow: The Legacies</I> of the Narragansetts 
        can help the rest of us come closer to that understanding.<br>

        <em>In the Shadow of the Crow: Legacies of the Narragansetts</em> is an 80 minute 
        documentary with a focus on tribal sovereignty and the difficulties of 
        preserving tribal tradition in contemporary culture. <br>
        Alexia Kosmider brought me a video rough cut of this remarkable work. 
        She left it on my doorstep: it filled my afternoon with powerful voices 
        and faces on the magic screen. All our convenient devices and gadgets 
        strike me like gypsy crystal balls. Among these close-ups you will meet 
        youthful tribal leaders as well as wise women and elders with strong bonds 
        to the rivers and woodlands of the region and the reservation lands. The 
        disturbing July 14, 2003 smoke shop incident which took place on Narragansett 
        territory — which was broadcast on national news, is at the heart of the 
        movie. Radiating out from that newscast footage, chapters of the history 
        of the tribal nation astonish the viewer and listener. </font> </font></font></div>

        <font color="#FFFFFF" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        Narragansett range extended all over New England. Native language, nearly 
        vanished, contains hints of the ties of the Narragansett people along 
        the rivers and forests of what is now Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont 
        and Maine. <br>
        This reviewer recalls Princess Redwing who studied the migrations, the 
        scattering, the heritage, the music and crafts of the diminished Narragansett 
        nation. I interviewed her on television and invited her to my classes. 
        She is shown among the archival material in Shadow of the Crow. These 
        black and white icons are included to remind us that the pow-wows of summertime 
        are not a new or contrived event, but a continuity. The footage of the 
        landscape with reminders of the richness of resources that exist now only 
        in place names whose meanings have evaporated retains the power to move 
        an honest audience. Salmon ran. The red color is remembered in the Indian 
        place names. Fish were used also for fertilizer for the gardens. During 
        such difficult times as the Great Depression the skills of surviving made 
        it possible for families to stay together in the face of prejudice and 
        poverty. Despite the “rough cut” version I studied, the movie has a logic 
        and a poignancy beyond its rhetoric. The thoughtful faces and voices of 
        these people have depth and dignity. My only criticism? I would love to 
        have a face and voice from the “other side,” an interview with the governor 
        perhaps, so that one feels in the presence of poetry rather than propaganda. 
        And an editor who might offer these marvelous testaments to a wider audience 
        through a briefer final form.<br>
