          <p><span class="style3">Since the beginning Native people have lived in<br>
              New England—but when Alexia asked her students 
              at URI whether any &ldquo;Indians&rdquo;  
              lived in Rhode Island        &mdash;the answer always has been a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash;
              and so began our film. &ldquo;Legacies of the Narragansetts&rdquo;
              explores the history of the Narragansett people and 
              their legacies        &mdash;their invisibility, their struggle to maintain 
              their cultural beliefs  
              and the continued and systemic 
              genocide of their culture, their  

              people. It probes the political, 
              economic, and the cultural warfare 
              that has been raging 
              prior to the Great Swamp Massacre of 1675.  
              The film looks<br> 
            for answers that have gone unaddressed and tries 
              to encompass and to provide the different perspectives
              of living  
              in Rhode Island as a Narragansett Indian
              in the 21st century.</span><br>

            </blockquote>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>This interview was conducted on February 9, 2004 <br>
              The interviewer was Debbie Monuteaux, a videographer with the film. Debbie
              conducted this interview on behalf of the Student Government Board of the University of Rhode Island, Providence, Feinstein Campus. The board is one of the sponsors of this project.</strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Interview conducted at Leslie Langley's home in Attleboro , Massachusetts at dinnertime. <br>
              <br>
            </strong><strong>Debbie Monuteaux : Why another documentary about the Narragansetts? <br>
            <br>
            </strong><strong>Alexia Kosmider: It's important to keep the Narragansett's issue alive. One way is to make certain that the Narragansetts remain visible. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Debbie Monuteaux: Why do you think that the Narragansett are not visible and to whom? </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Alexia Kosmider: I know from four years of teaching Native American literature at the University of Rhode Island that many students are not aware at all about the presence of Native people in the New England area. The students whom I teach, I think, reflect the majority of non-native New Englanders' perspective on Indians. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Debbie Monuteaux: But why is that so important to you? </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Alexia Kosmider: Because as a teacher of Native American literature—it is important that students and other non-natives know that literature comes from somewhere; Native people have a large body of literature, creation stories, poetry, tribal stories—to mention only a few-- that make a strong contribution to the history and culture of this area. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Debbie Monuteaux : Why is it important that the average student know about Native cultures? </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Alexia Kosmider: This is a part of their history too—there are lessons to be learned—ways in which we have treated native people in the past play a part in the present –that we become aware of these lessons and learn from them. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Leslie Langley: The film is titled “Legacies of the Narragansetts”—unfortunately, the legacies continue. What I see is that the Narragansetts are being treated in the same ways in which they were treated prior to the Great Swamp Massacre. This needs to be looked at and addressed and then perhaps attitudes and relations between between Euro-Americans and Indian will change. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Debbie Monuteaux: Visually –what is compelling about this story? </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Leslie Langley: The Narragansetts people prior to the European invasion had it right. They seemed to take what they needed from the land, no more. Out of respect for the earth. They were and still appear connected to the earth. When their energies are channeled to survival—they can lose their vision. The Narragansett people had a vision—it is close to what they are. That's exactly what we're trying to portray—vision. The elders of the tribe are trying desperately to pass this on to their children. It is like Michael Bliss at the Rhode Island Indian Council spends every Friday evening, along with his wife and other elders, teaching young Indian children traditional dances so that that these young people feel connected to their tribe and histories. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Debbie Monuteaux : Tell me a little bit about the “story.” </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Alexia Kosmider : It's to help dispel some of the myths about the Narragansett people. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Debbie Monuteaux : What are some of the myths? </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Alexia Kosmider: Many people do not recognize that there are Narragansett people still present in this state. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Leslie Langley: Many people believe that the tribe was detribalized and eliminated and assimilated into the dominant culture. When the truth is that the tribe is still here and vital. </strong></p>
            <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>Alexia Kosmider: Our purpose is to make the Narragansett visible that to a larger audience and to show what it is to be a Narragansett in the 21 st century. </strong></p>
